# BlockEHR
Health Records on Blockchain

CS-5800 Final Year Blockchain Project supervised by Prof. Dr. R. Wei

## Description
Blockchain is a recent technology which maintains a public chain of records which are connected to each other using security algorithms of cryptography. In this project, we proposed and implemented a system which can be used to share patient’s medical file records securely through blockchain and cryptography algorithms like Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and Rivest, Shamir, Adleman (RSA) were implemented to encrypt and decrypt the records. The figure below depicts the architecture of the proposed system.

## Features
- Decentralized architecture
- Reduced client dependencies (only Metamask required)
- Encrypted and Decrypted Records Sharing
- User need not remember all the keys to all the files, just one Private Key required
- User need not handle transaction gas costs
- No centralized database used
- Login without password hassles
- We have our own BlockEHR Explorer!
